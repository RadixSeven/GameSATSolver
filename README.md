This is a SAT solver I made (based on
https://sahandsaba.com/understanding-sat-by-implementing-a-simple-sat-solver-in-python.html)
because I thought it would help me in a coding problem. But after
working it out, I realized it won't work directly. (The naive
expression of the problem in Conjunctive Normal Form is exponential in
the number of terms in the original problem. I should have checked
that earlier.)
